Repo for Programming Fundamentals course

These Labs and Programming Assignements (PAs) were completed by me during my Spring 2018 semester at James Madison University

They display my proficiency with the fundamentals of object oriented programming (classes, objects, methods, if/else statements, loops, basic testing, etc.)
